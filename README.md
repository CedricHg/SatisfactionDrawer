# SatisfactionDrawer
Rating system that detects positive or negative feedback based on the shape of a smiley drawn by a user.

SatisfactionSlider was nice, but slider controls are old-fashioned. We live in an era of opinionated social media. To keep with the times it is much better to allow a user to indicate their feelings using the freedom of artful expression.
